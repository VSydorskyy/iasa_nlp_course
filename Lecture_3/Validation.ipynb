    "# What is validation and why do we need it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ML models validation process is a crucial step in developing machine learning models. It involves assessing the performance and generalization capabilities of a trained model to ensure that it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. There are such key points in evaluating models:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generalization performance** - We want to estimate the predictive performance of our model on future (unseen) data.\n",
    "- Ideally, the estimated performance (based on evaluation metrics) of a model tells us how well it performs on unseen data, because making predictions on future (unseen) data is often the main problem we want to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperparameters tuning and feature engineering** - We want to increase the predictive performance by tweaking the learning algorithm and selecting the best performing model from a given hypothesis space.\n",
    "- Typically, machine learning involves a lot of experimentation. Running a learning algorithm over a training dataset with different hyperparameter settings and different features will result in different models. Since we are typically interested in selecting the best-performing model from this set, we need to find a way to estimate their respective performances in order to rank them against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model selection** - We want to compare different ML models (e.g. linear, decision tree, gradient boosting, etc.), selecting the best-performing one.\n",
    "- We are usually not only experimenting with the one single algorithm that we think would be the “best solution” under the given circumstances. More often than not, we want to compare different models to each other, oftentimes in terms of predictive and computational performance."

    "# 2. Evaluation metrics\n",
    "An evaluation metric, in the context of machine learning and data analysis, is a quantitative measure used to assess the performance or quality of a model or a system's output with respect to a specific task or objective. Evaluation metrics are crucial because they provide a standardized way to measure and compare the performance of different models or systems. The choice of evaluation metric depends on the nature of the task being addressed (e.g. classification, regression, ranking) and the specific goals and requirements of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='loss_and_metric'></a>\n",
    "## 2.1 Optimization Loss and Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "Optimization loss and evaluation metrics serve different roles in the context of machine learning model training and evaluation. Here are the key differences between the two: <br>\n",
    "1. **Purpose**: <br>\n",
    "    **Optimization Loss:** often simply referred to as \"loss,\" is a mathematical function that the machine learning model aims to minimize during training. It serves as the objective function that guides the model's parameter updates during optimization. The primary purpose of the loss function is to measure the dissimilarity between the model's predictions and the true target values. It provides the model with a signal for adjusting its internal parameters to improve its predictive performance on the training data. The model's parameters are updated in the direction that reduces this loss, using techniques like gradient descent.<br>\n",
    "    **Evaluation Metric:** used to assess the model's performance and quality after it has been trained and to evaluate how well it generalizes to new, unseen data. These metrics are not used during training but rather during the model evaluation phase to provide a quantitative measure of how well the model is achieving its intended task. Evaluation metrics are often chosen based on the specific problem and the practical goals of the application.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Function properties:** <br>\n",
    "    **Optimization Loss:** differentiable \"almost everywhere\" with respect to model parameters function that is well-suited for gradient-based optimization algorithms. Common examples include mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) for regression tasks and cross-entropy loss for classification tasks. <br>\n",
    "    **Evaluation Metric:** both continuous and discrete, are usually much better interpretable than loss, depending on the nature of the task. Examples include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, roc-auc, mean absolute percentage error, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are \"good\" and \"bad\" properties of different evaluation metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **differentiability \"almost everywhere\"** - is definitely a good property, because this kind of a metrics could serve as a training loss, so you can directly optimize it with SGD-based methods.\n",
    "- **multiclass/multivariate extensibility** - is definitely a good property, because in many real-life tasks you'll need to handle multicalss/multivariate ML problems, so you can extend your regular metric to them.\n",
    "- **reference values** - is definitely a good property, because if the metric has some reference values (e.g. ROCAUC=0.5), then without deep-diving into the problem itself and the nature of the data, we can immediately say whether the solution is rather good or not.\n",
    "- **interpretability** - is rather good property. When we talk about interpretability in terms of ML evaluation metrics, we're often discussing how understandable the metrics themselves are (especially by people without a deep background in ML), as well as how well they allow us to interpret the performance and characteristics of the model. Although, understanding more complex and less interpretable metrics fully may require some background knowledge, but they may provide deeper insights into some specific aspects of model performance.\n",
    "- **values limitation** - is rather good property, because if metric values are limited in some specific range is there is no risk of getting +-infinity values, with which it is not very clear what to do.\n",
    "- **outliers resistance** - is rather a good property, but only for problems in which outliers are not so important, e.g. in algo-trading there could be \"outlier\"-like situations in the market which can lead to your algorithm losing most of its money at once -> so you'll need to take care of outliers and doesn't use outlier-resistant metrics.\n",
    "- **equivalence of accounting for errors of the first and second types** - very much depends on the business task itself. E.g. in the classical credit scoring problem you would rather lend to fewer people, but who will definitely return your money, than to a much larger number of people who will not return your money (precision-based optimization), on the other hand in the task of primary disease diagnosis it is much more important to correctly identify all people with a disease, while falsely identifying healthy people as sick, than to very accurately identify those who are sick while missing half (recall-based optimization)\n",

    "## 2.2 Classification metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary machine learning classification task is a type of supervised learning problem in which the goal is to categorize data points into one of two distinct classes or categories. In other words, the output or prediction of the model is the probability distribution of an element belonging to the corresponding classes. These two classes are often referred to as the positive class and the negative class. The objective is to learn a model that can accurately classify new, unseen data points into one of these two classes based on the features or attributes of the data.\n",

In regression tasks, the target variable is continuous, and the model's objective is to learn a mapping from input features to this continuous output.\n",

You'll build a model that evaluates how well a student represents the main idea and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary. You'll have access to a collection of real student summaries to train your model.\n",

    "RMSE and MSE is similiar in terms of minimizers - value minimizes RMSE **if and only if** it minimizes MSE. This means that in terms of competitions we can optimize MSE instead of RMSE. In fact it is easier to work with MSE. But there is a little bit of difference between the two for gradient-based models. The gradient of RMSE with respect to i-th prediction is basically equal to gradient of MSE multiplied by some value. The value doesn't depend on the index I. It means that travelling along MSE gradient is equivalent to traveling along RMSE gradient but with a different flowing rate and the flowing rate depends on MSE score itself. So, it is kind of dynamic.So even though RMSE and MSE are really similar in terms of models scoring, they can be not immediately interchangeable for gradient based methods. We will probably need to adjust some parameters like the learning rate.\n",

    "    \n",
    "### Class Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "As it was said, you want your validation to mimic your test set as close as possible. And you can make a fair assumprion (that is not always true), that distribution of target on train and not seen data is the same. Then you have to use stratification. Stratification ensures stable distributions across split. That is more than just useful if:\n",
    "\n",
    "    + Dataset is small\n",
    "    + Dataset is unbalanced (average target close to 0 or to 1)\n",
    "    + You have multiclassification task\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Model Checkpoint Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider gradient-based training of models, for example neural networks or gradient boosting, then as a result of each epoch there will be some new model weights. Thus, the model at different epochs will behave differently on previously unseen data, so it is logical for the best result to choose a checkpoint from the epoch at which the target metric has the best values on previously unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by selecting the weights of the model in this way, we can also get some kind of overfit, since we choose these weights as the best according to the validation dataset, it is quite obvious that on average on any other previously unseen dataset the results of our model in terms of metrics will be worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in order to correctly select a model checkpoint after optimization or implement early stopping and also correctly estimate the results of the model on previously unseen data, we can apply train/validation/test strategy.\n",

You want to evaluate a machine learning model's ability to predict the correct author of a text or to have ability to predict different text attributes or properties for previously unseen authors. To avoid data leakage, you can use GroupKFold with author IDs as the grouping variable. This ensures that all texts from the same author are in the same fold during cross-validation.\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis: In sentiment analysis tasks, where you classify text based on sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral), you might have reviews or comments grouped by products, movies, or topics. GroupKFold helps ensure that all reviews for a specific product or movie are together in one fold during cross-validation.\n",

We, therefore, create a new target column in which the test samples are labeled 1 and the train samples with 0. <br>\n",

What could be happening and should we describe this kind of performance as \"rather good, because the accuracy is high\" or \"rather bad, because the precision/recall/f1 is low\"?\n",
    "> - Describe cases (or provide examples) in which in a multiclass classification problem the values of F1 macro will be greater than F1 micro and vice versa? What do you think happens more often in practice and why?\n",
    "> - Imagine that you are in production developing a similar system for Twitter for identifying real disasters, think about whether the split proposed by the organizers (random, possibly with stratification by target) is optimal for a production model validation (assume that you have all the possible necessary data here) and if you think it could be not optimal - describe your ideas?\n",
    "> - For the task of recognizing disasters from tweets and quickly reacting to them by the relevant government authorities, describe cases or pipelines for processing suspected disasters for which a precision-optimized model would be more useful, and for which a recall-optimized one?\n",
    "> - For a task similar to the one proposed above (commonlit-evaluate-student-summaries) regression for both targets with the same input tables structure (assume that the uniqueness/non-uniqueness of ids fields corresponds to the proposed here problem statement). Propose and describe in writing validation strategies in such cases:<br>\n",
    "> A) Case in which we want to evaluate other students on the same questions (prompt text + prompt question); <br>\n",
    "> B) Case in which we want to evaluate the same students on different (unseen) questions (prompt text + prompt question); <br>\n",
